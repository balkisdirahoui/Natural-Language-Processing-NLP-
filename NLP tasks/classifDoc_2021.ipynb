    "# Classification de documents : prise en main des outils\n",
    "\n",
    "Le but de ce TP est de classer des documents textuels... Dans un premier temps, nous allons vÃ©rifier le bon fonctionnement des outils sur des donnÃ©es jouets puis appliquer les concepts sur des donnÃ©es rÃ©elles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conception de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "Pour rappel, une chaine de traitement de documents classique est composÃ©e des Ã©tapes suivantes:\n",
    "1. Lecture des donnÃ©es et importation\n",
    "    - Dans le cadre de nos TP, nous faisons l'hypothÃ¨se que le corpus tient en mÃ©moire... Si ce n'est pas le cas, il faut alors ajouter des structures de donnÃ©es avec des buffers (*data-reader*), bien plus complexes Ã  mettre en place.\n",
    "    - Le plus grand piÃ¨ge concerne l'encodage des donnÃ©es. Dans le TP... Pas (ou peu) de problÃ¨me. Dans la vraie vie: il faut faire attention Ã  toujours maitriser les formats d'entrÃ©e et de sortie.\n",
    "1. Traitement des donnÃ©es brutes paramÃ©trique. Chaque traitement doit Ãªtre activable ou desactivable + paramÃ©trable si besoin.\n",
    "    - Enlever les informations *inutiles* : chiffre, ponctuations, majuscules, etc... <BR>\n",
    "    **L'utilitÃ© dÃ©pend de l'application!**\n",
    "    - Segmenter en mots (=*Tokenization*)\n",
    "    - Elimination des stop-words\n",
    "    - Stemming/lemmatisation (racinisation)\n",
    "    - Byte-pair encoding pour trouver les mots composÃ©s (e.g. Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, Ville de Paris, Premier Ministre, etc...)\n",
    "1. Traitement des donnÃ©es numÃ©riques\n",
    "    - Normalisation *term-frequency* / binarisation\n",
    "    - Normalisation *inverse document frequency*\n",
    "    - Elimination des mots rares, des mots trop frÃ©quents\n",
    "    - Construction de critÃ¨re de sÃ©parabilitÃ© pour Ã©liminer des mots etc...\n",
    "1. Apprentissage d'un classifieur\n",
    "    - Choix du type de classifieur\n",
    "    - RÃ©glage des paramÃ¨tres du classifieur (rÃ©gularisation, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploitation de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "\n",
    "On appelle cette Ã©tape la rÃ©alisation d'une campagne d'expÃ©riences: c'est le point clÃ© que nous voulons traviller en TAL cette annÃ©e.\n",
    "1. Il est impossible de tester toutes les combinaisons par rapport aux propositions ci-dessus... Il faut donc en Ã©liminer un certain nombre.\n",
    "    - En discutant avec les experts mÃ©tiers\n",
    "    - En faisant des tests prÃ©liminaires\n",
    "1. AprÃ¨s ce premier filtrage, il faut:\n",
    "    - Choisir une Ã©valuation fiable et pas trop lente (validation croisÃ©e, leave-one-out, split apprentissage/test simple)\n",
    "    - Lancer des expÃ©riences en grand\n",
    "        - = *grid-search*\n",
    "        - parallÃ¨liser sur plusieurs machines\n",
    "        - savoir lancer sur un serveur et se dÃ©connecter\n",
    "1. Collecter et analyser les rÃ©sultats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## InfÃ©rence\n",
    "\n",
    "L'infÃ©rence est ensuite trÃ¨s classique: la chaine de traitement optimale est apte Ã  traiter de nouveaux documents\n",

      "that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \n",
      "after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \n",
      "this movie stinks out loud . \n",
      "quite frankly , this movie deserves a . \n",

      "i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \n",
      "to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \n",
      "with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \n",
      "so what is this movie about ? \n",
      "you ask . \n",
      "like it really matters . \n",
      "ok , here goes . \n",

      "once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \n",
      "everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \n",
      "there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \n",
      ">from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \n",
      "other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \n",
      "the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \n",
      "mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \n",
      "now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \n",
      "ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \n",
      "maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \n",
      "i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \n",
      "but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \n",
      "i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \n",
      "in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \n",
      "add to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \n",
      "i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \n",
      "then we have the cast . \n",
      "first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \n",
      "this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \n",
      "sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks . \n",
      "if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you . \n",

      "dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \n",
      "and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \n",
      "and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \n",
      "sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \n",
      "hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . \n",
      "then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \n",
      "this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \n",
      "meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \n",
      "sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \n",
      "on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \n",
      "i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . \n",
      "but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \n",
      "and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \n",
      "the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \n",
      "unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \n",
      "and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \n",
      "this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \n",

      "kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . \n",
      "frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . \n",
      "his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . \n",

      "images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . \n",
      "scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . \n",
      "people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . \n",
      "seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . \n",
      "kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . \n",
      "of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . \n",

Une fois la fonction $\\hat y = f(x)$ apprise, il est possible de la *bidouiller* a posteriori: si toutes les prÃ©dictions $\\hat y$ sont dans une classe, on va introduire $b$ dans $\\hat y = f(x) + b$ et le faire varier jusqu'Ã  ce qu'un des points change de classe. On peut ensuite aller de plus en plus loin.\n",
